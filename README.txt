README

This repository is for a python script that will help me test some theories about the game ERS.

The repository shall have the function to allow 'n' players to play a game with 'm' decks and shall 
eventually also include functionality for slapping cards away.

Slapping cards will be based on a RNG and skill rating for each player's reaction time.

The main goal, though, is to allow us to evaluate the stability (or instability) of the game with certain 
numbers of players and decks of cards. This will also prove to be a better first foray into card game 
analysis than my original pass at "oh hell".
